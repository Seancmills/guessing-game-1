This is a new branch of the guessing game assignment, created on 1/6/2016
The first 3 questions asks the user questions about Iris. The 4th question asks user to guess a number. An alert lets the user know how many questions they got correct out of the 4 questions. The 5th question uses a while loop to ask user to guess a number; if wrong they can try again.
